# [Random Oscars](https://randomoscars.github.io)

Hit the button and get a random Academy Award category from a random year. A simple app for when [Blank Check](https://twitter.com/blankcheckpod) gets around to doing a spreadsheet episode.

## Background

Blank Check co-host [David Sims](https://twitter.com/davidlsims) revealed he has a spreadsheet of what would have been his Academy Award nominations, for most categories, for most of the Oscars' history. They've discussed doing an episode diving into "the spreadsheet" for a few years. 

During the [January 2022 mailbag episode](https://www.patreon.com/posts/sixth-blank-61013728), Griffin asked someone to make a tool for picking random Oscar categories, to suggest parts of the spreadsheet to look at. 

I am a web developer with too much time on my hands, so I made a tool to do that. I am also the guy who made the [Bruce Willis random movie title generator](https://www.kylenazario.com/blog/bruce-willis-name-generator.html) after Griffin joked about it on the [*Glass* episode](https://soundcloud.com/griffin-and-david-present/glass) (Feel like there's a trend?).

## Caveats

AFAIK there is no great API for Academy Awards (though you can [search them on the Academy's website](https://awardsdatabase.oscars.org)). The data I found is mostly complete, maybe minus some people in Song and Score.

The categories have also changed over the years, so not every year has every category.
